\title{Unveiling the Syntax Within: Interpreting Grammar Embeddings in Metaâ€™s LLaMA Models}


% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
  This paper investigates the mechanisms by which large language models (LLMs) encode 
  grammatical knowledge, focusing on Meta's LLaMA models. By leveraging embedding vectors, 
  we classify grammatically correct sentences and analyze the activation patterns of 
  attention heads to identify their roles in processing specific grammatical structures. 
  Furthermore, we explore the effects of selectively removing these attention heads, shedding 
  light on how grammar is embedded within the model's architecture. Our findings aim to enhance
  the understanding of LLMs' linguistic capabilities and their internal organization of syntactic knowledge.
